# MIPS-Disassembler
BU MET CS 472 Project 1

"Your project is to write a partial disassembler for MIPS instructions. That is, your input will be the 32-bit
machine instructions that a compiler or assembler produces. Your program then figures out what the
original source instructions were that created those 32-bit machine instructions and outputs them. The
possible source instructions that you must be able to disassemble are: add, sub, and, or, slt, lw, sw, beq,
bne. Ignore all other MIPS instructions."
